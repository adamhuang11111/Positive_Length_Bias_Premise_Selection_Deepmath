# Positive Bias and Length Bias: How Deep Neural Sequence Differs toHuman Cognition in Premises Selection

## Abstract
We compare here the premises selections of the deepneural sequence models with that of human cognition.We train fully-connected neural networks with differ-ent numbers of hidden units and an LSTM using con-jecture  and  axiom  pairs  from  the  Mizar  Mathemati-cal Library and compare the networksâ€™ performances.We then compare the premises choices for a sample of5 conjecture and axiom pairs from 9 college studentsto  that  of  our  network  model.   We  find  that  the  net-work models tend to classify more premises as neces-sary and predict more accurately with greater number ofpremises, which contrasts with the pattern humans ex-hibits. We propose that the Positive Bias and the LengthBias  makes  the  network  models  distinct  from  humancognition.

## Description
The github repository records the class project "Positive Bias and Length Bias: How Deep Neural Sequence Differs toHuman Cognition in Premises Selection", which needs more human data and examination of up-to-date model to get published.

## Models
The models can be found in the experiments folders. The files containing the training the models are prefixxed "Network".
